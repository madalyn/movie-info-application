movie-info-application
======================

About:
This is a C# coding project to display info on movies currently in theaters. This is a command-line application that prompts the user for the number of top movies to get information on.

How to Run:
Please note this application takes some time to run, as it needs to get the accurate information from Rotton Tomatoes and Freebase. Also note that the more movies you ask about, the slower it will take to run.

To run this application, you must be connected to the internet.

When prompted, you must enter the number of movies you wish to know about.
